/* LEARNING C# AGAIN IN MTEC 2120. SPRING 2023 SEMESTER. We went over different things like

changing the color of a gameObject and doing the same thing with the press of a button and having a sphere orbitating

another sphere pretending it is the sun orbiting a planet. We also went over a countdown that changes color and it

updates every second.
